## First words and sentences

| Word   | Definition              |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| _mi_   | I, me, we, us           |

| _lape_ | to sleep, to rest       |
| _pona_ | good, excellent, simple |
| _ike_  | bad, complex            |

To make a sentence, start with a subject (_mi_ or _sina_), and add a verb.

- _mi moku._ **I eat.**
- _sina lape._ **You sleep.**
- _mi pona._ **I am good.**

There's no verb for "to be". You may directly use adjectives (like _pona_) as
verbs.

| _soweli_ | animal, land mammal |
| _lili_   | small               |

translated as _jan Sakawi_.

Names are often tokiponized, or simplified to fit with toki pona's rules. There
are only 5 rules:

- Syllables must have a consonant, then a vowel, then an optional _n_.
- The first syllable may omit a consonant.
- The consonant clusters _nm_ and _nn_ are banned.
- Syllables starting with _ji_, _wo_, or _wu_ are banned.
- The syllables _ti_ and _tin_ are changed to _si_ and _sin_.

| _pini_  | completed, done, past, to end, to finish |

  **In the future, I eat.**

## Complex Sentences

<div class="flex flex-col gap-6">

Some English sentences turn into two sentences when translated to toki pona.

When the first sentence ends with _e ni_ and is connected to the second, you
must join them with a colon instead of a period.

- _mi wile e ni: sina tawa tomo mi._  
  **I want this: you go to my house.**  
  **I want you to visit me.**

- _sina sona e ni: mi toki e toki pona._  
  **You know that I speak toki pona.**

</div>

---

<div class="flex flex-col gap-6">

Sometimes, you can use _pi_ instead of splitting a sentence in two. It's a
matter of personal preference. Note the differences between these two:

- _mi jo e soweli. ona li toki e toki Inli._  
  **I have a dog. It speaks English.**

- _mi jo e soweli pi toki Inli._  
  **I have a dog of English-speaking.**

| _a_  | emotion word, exclamation |
| _mu_ | animal noise              |

The interjection _a_ can be used after any noun phrase or sentence to emphasize
it. On its own, it represents a generic exclamation.

The interjection _mu_ means any animal noise. It can be a sentence on its own.
