## First words and sentences

| Word   | Definition              |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| _mi_   | I, me, we, us           |

| _moku_ | food, to eat, to drink  |
| _lape_ | to sleep, to rest       |
| _pona_ | good, excellent, simple |
| _ike_  | bad, complex            |

To make a sentence, start with a subject (_mi_ or _sina_), and add a verb.

- _mi moku._ **I eat.**
- _sina lape._ **You sleep.**
- _mi pona._ **I am good.**

There's no verb for "to be". You may directly use adjectives (like _pona_) as
verbs.
